            Crop recommendation is a crucial component of precision agriculture. These recommendations depend on several factors that influence crop growth and productivity. Precision agriculture aims to identify and analyze these factors at a site-specific level to improve crop selection decisions. Although the site-specific approach has enhanced agricultural performance, continuous monitoring of the system outcomes is still necessary. Not all precision agriculture systems operate in the same way. In agriculture, it is extremely important that the recommendations provided are accurate and reliable, because mistakes can lead to considerable loss of resources and financial investment
